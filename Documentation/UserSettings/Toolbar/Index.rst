Activate the right toolbar as overlay or push
---------------------------------------------

If the user has a smaller screen, the default push effect behaviour of the right toolbar can make the screen very size small. There is a possibility to choose which behaviour should be used.

Push
----

Push is the default which pushes all the content to the left.

Overlay
-------

This is added as an overlay and behaves in the same way as the left toolbar with the page tree.

The settings can be changes in the Users personal settings:

|img-activate-rightbar-overlay|
